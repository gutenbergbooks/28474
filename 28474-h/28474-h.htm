<h3>OBLATION OF A WHITE BULL.</h3>

  <p>By lease dated 28th April, 1533, the Abbat of St. Edmund's Bury
  demised to John Wright, glazier, and John Anable, pewterer, of Bury, the
  manor of Haberdon appurtenant to the office of Sacrist in that monastery,
  with four acres in the Vynefeld, for twenty years, at the rent of
  5<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i> to the Sacrist; the tenants also to find a white
  bull every year of their term, as often as it should happen that any
  gentlewoman, or any other woman, should, out of devotion, visit the
  shrine of the glorious king and martyr of St. Edmund, and wish to make
  the oblation of a white bull. (Dodsw. Coll. in <i>Bibl. Bodl.</i>, vol.
  lxxi. f. 72.)</p>

  <p>If we are to understand a white bull of the ancient race of wild white
  cattle, it may be inferred, I suppose, that in some forest in the
  vicinity of Bury St. Edmund's they had not disappeared in the first half
  of the sixteenth century. The wild cattle, probably indigenous to the
  great Caledonian forest, seem to have become extinct in a wild state
  before the time of Leland, excepting where preserved in certain ancient
  parks, as Chillingham Park, Northumberland, Gisburne Park in Craven,
  &amp;c., where they were, and in the former at all events still are,
  maintained in their original purity of breed. They were preserved on the
  lands of some abbeys; for instance, by the Abbats of Whalley,
  Lancashire.</p>

  <p>Whitaker (<i>History of Craven</i>, p. 34.) mentions Gisburne Park as
  chiefly remarkable for a herd of wild cattle, descendants of that
  indigenous race which once roamed in the great forests of Lancashire, and
  they are said by some other writer to have been originally brought to
  Gisburne from Whalley after the dissolution. One of the descendants of
  Robert de Brus, the founder of Gainsborough Priory, is stated by Matthew
  Paris to have conciliated King John with a present of white cattle. The
  woods of Chillingham Castle are celebrated at this day for the breed of
  this remarkable race, by which they are inhabited; and I believe there
  are three or four other places in which they are preserved.</p>

  <p>In the form and direction of the horns, these famous wild white oxen
  seem to be living <!-- Page 2 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page2"></a>{2}</span>representatives of the race whose bones are
  found in a fossil state in England and some parts of the Continent in the
  "diluvium" bone-caves, mixed with the bones of bears, hyenas, and other
  wild animals, now the cotemporaries of the Bos Gour, or Asiatic Ox, upon
  mountainous slopes of Western India. I have read that white cattle
  resembling the wild cattle of Chillingham exist in Italy, and that it has
  been doubted whether our British wild cattle are descendants of an
  aboriginal race, or were imported by ecclesiastics from Italy. But this
  seems unlikely, because they were not so easily brought over as the
  Pope's <i>bulls</i> (the pun is quite unavoidable), and were undoubtedly
  inhabitants of our ancient forests at a very early period.</p>

  <p>However, my present object is only to inquire for any other instances
  of the custom of offering a white bull in honour of a Christian saint.
  Perhaps some of your correspondents would elucidate this singular
  oblation.</p>

  <p>I am not able to refer to Col. Hamilton Smith's work on the mythology
  and ancient history of the ox, which may possibly notice this kind of
  offering.</p>

<h3>NEWSTEAD ABBEY.</h3>

  <p>The descent of property, like the family pedigree, occasionally
  exhibits the most extraordinary disruptions; and to those who may be
  ignorant of the cause, the effect may appear as romance. I have been
  particularly struck with the two interesting papers contained in the
  April number of the <i>Archæological Journal</i>, having reference to the
  Newstead Abbey estate, formerly the property of Lord Byron's family,
  which, amongst other matters, contain some severe remarks on the conduct
  of one of its proprietors, the great uncle and predecessor of our great
  poet, and having reference to dilapidation. Mr. Pettigrew, in his paper,
  states that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Family differences, particularly during the time of the fifth Lord
  Byron, <i>of eccentric and unsocial manners</i>, suffered and even aided
  the dilapidations of time. The castellated stables and offices are,
  however, yet to be seen."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And Mr. Ashpitel adds that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The state of Newstead at the time the poet succeeded to the estate is
  not generally known: '<i>the wicked lord</i>' had felled all the noble
  oaks, destroyed the finest herds of deer, and, in short, had denuded the
  estate of everything he could. The hirelings of the attorney did the
  rest: they stripped away all the furniture, and everything the law would
  permit them to remove. The buildings on the east side were unroofed; the
  old Xenodochium, and the grand refectory, were full of hay; and the
  entrance-hall and monks' parlour were stable for cattle. In the only
  habitable part of the building, a place then used as a sort of scullery,
  under the only roof that kept out wet of all this vast pile, the fifth
  Lord Byron breathed his last; and to this inheritance the poet
  succeeded."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It is not necessary for me to refer to the lofty expression of the
  poet's feelings on such his inheritance, nor to the necessity of his
  parting from the estate, which appears now to be happily restored to its
  former splendour; but possessing some knowledge of a lamentable fact,
  that neither Mr. Pettigrew nor Mr. Ashpitel appears to be aware of, I
  feel inclined to soften the asperity of the reflections quoted; and
  palliate, although I may not justify, the apparently reckless proceedings
  of the eccentric fifth Lord, as he is called. In the years 1796 and 1797,
  after finishing my clerkship, I had a seat in the chambers of the late
  Jas. Hanson, Esq., an eminent conveyancer of Lincoln's Inn; and while
  with him, amongst other peers of the realm who came to consult Mr. Hanson
  regarding their property, we had this <i>eccentric</i> fifth Lord Byron,
  who apparently came up to town for the purpose, and under the most
  painful and pitiable load of distress,&mdash;and I must confess that I
  felt for him exceedingly; but his case was past remedy, and, after some
  daily attendance, pouring forth his lamentations, he appears to have
  returned home to subside into the reckless operations reported of him.
  His case was this:&mdash;Upon the marriage of his son, he, as any other
  father would do, granted a settlement of his property, including the
  Newstead Abbey estate; but by some unaccountable inadvertence or
  negligence of the lawyers employed, the ultimate reversion of the
  fee-simple of the property, instead of being left, as it ought to have
  been, in the father as the owner of the estates, was limited to the heirs
  of the son. And upon his death, and failure of the issue of the marriage,
  the unfortunate father, <i>this eccentric lord</i>, found himself robbed
  of the fee-simple of his own inheritance, and left merely the naked
  tenant for life, without any legal power of raising money upon it, or
  even of cutting down a tree. It is so many years ago, that I now do not
  remember the detail of what passed on these consultations, but it would
  appear, that if the lawyers were aware of the effect of the final
  limitation, neither father nor son appear to have been informed of it, or
  the result might have been corrected, and his lordship would probably
  have kept up the estate in its proper order. Whether this case was at all
  a promoting cause of the alteration of the law, I do not know; but, as
  the law now stands, the estate would revert back to the father as heir of
  this son. This case made a lasting impression on me, and I once had to
  correct a similar erroneous proposition in a large intended settlement;
  and I quoted this unfortunate accident as an authority. Now, although
  this relation may not fully justify the reckless waste that appears to
  have been committed, it certainly is a palliative. I do not recollect
  whether <!-- Page 3 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page3"></a>{3}</span>our fifth lord had any surviving daughter to
  provide for; but if he had, his situation would be a still more
  aggravated position.</p>

<h3>ON A CELEBRATED PASSAGE IN "ROMEO AND JULIET," ACT III. SC. 2.</h3>

  <p>Few passages in Shakspeare have so often and so ineffectually been
  "winnowed" as the opening of the beautiful and passionate soliloquy of
  Juliet, when ardently and impatiently invoking night's return, which was
  to bring her newly betrothed lover to her arms. It stands thus in the
  first folio, from which the best quarto differs only in a few unimportant
  points of orthography:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Gallop apace, you fiery footed steedes,</p>
      <p>Towards Ph&oelig;bus' lodging, such a wagoner</p>
      <p>As Phaeton should whip you to the wish,</p>
      <p>And bring in cloudie night immediately.</p>
      <p>Spred thy close curtaine, Loue-performing night,</p>
      <p>That run-awayes eyes may wincke, and Romeo</p>
      <p>Leape to these armes, untalkt of and unseene", &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The older commentators do not attempt to change the word
  <i>run-awayes</i>, but seek to explain it. Warburton says Ph&oelig;bus is
  the runaway. Steevens has a long argument to prove that Night is the
  runaway. Douce thought Juliet herself was the runaway; and at a later
  period the Rev. Mr. Halpin, in a very elegant and ingenious essay,
  attempts to prove that by the runaway we must understand Cupid.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Knight</span> and <span class="sc">Mr.
  Collier</span> have both of them adopted Jackson's conjecture of
  <i>unawares</i>, and have admitted it to the honour of a place in the
  text, but <span class="sc">Mr. Dyce</span> has pronounced it to be
  "villainous;" and it must be confessed that it has nothing but a slight
  similarity to the old word to recommend it. <span class="sc">Mr.
  Dyce</span> himself has favoured us with three suggestions; the first two
  in his <i>Remarks on Collier and Knight's Shakspeare</i>, in 1844, where
  he says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"That <i>ways</i> (the last syllable of <i>run-aways</i>) ought to be
  <i>days</i>, I feel next to certain; but what word originally preceded it
  I do not pretend to determine:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Spread thy close curtain, love-performing Night!</p>
      <p>That rude/soon (?) Day's eyes may wink, and Romeo</p>
      <p>Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen,' &amp;c."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

</blockquote>

  <p>The correctors of <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span>'s folio having
  substituted&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"That <i>enemies</i> eyes may wink,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Dyce</span>, in his recent <i>Few Notes</i>,
  properly rejects that reading, and submits another conjecture of his own,
  founded on the supposition that the word <i>roving</i> having been
  written illegibly, <i>roavinge</i> was mistaken for <i>run-awayes</i>,
  and proposes to read&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"That <i>roving</i> eyes may wink."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Every suggestion of <span class="sc">Mr. Dyce</span>, certainly the
  most competent of living commentators on Shakspeare, merits attention;
  but I cannot say that I think he has succeeded in either of his proposed
  readings.</p>

  <p>Monck Mason seems to have had the clearest notion of the requirements
  of the passage. He saw that "the word, whatever the meaning of it might
  be, was intended as a proper name;" but he was not happy in suggesting
  <i>renomy</i>, a French word with an English termination.</p>

  <p>In the course of his note he mentions that Heath, "the author of the
  <i>Revisal</i>, reads '<i>Rumour's</i> eyes may wink;' which agrees in
  sense with the rest of the passage, but differs widely from
  <i>run-aways</i> in the trace of the letters."</p>

  <p>I was not conscious of having seen this suggestion of Heath's, when,
  in consequence of a question put to me by a gentleman of distinguished
  taste and learning, I turned my thoughts to the passage, and at length
  came to the conclusion that the word must have been <i>rumourers</i>, and
  that from its unfrequent occurrence (the only other example of it at
  present known to me being one afforded by the poet) the printer mistook
  it for <i>runawayes</i>; which, when written indistinctly, it may have
  strongly resembled. I therefore think that we may read with some
  confidence:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Spread thy close curtains, love-performing Night,</p>
      <p>That <i>rumourers'</i> eyes may wink, and Romeo</p>
      <p>Leap to these arms, <i>untalk'd of</i> and <i>unseen</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It fulfils the requirements of both metre and sense, and the words
  <i>untalk'd of</i> and <i>unseen</i> make it nearly indisputable. I had
  at first thought it might be "<i>rumorous</i> eyes;" but the
  personification would then be wanting. Shakspeare has personified
  <i>Rumour</i> in the Introduction to the Second Part of <i>King Henry
  IV.</i>; and in <i>Coriolanus</i>, Act IV. Sc. 6., we have&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Go see this <i>rumourer</i> whipp'd."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>I am gratified by seeing that I have anticipated your able
  correspondent, the <span class="sc">Rev. Mr. Arrowsmith</span>, in his
  elucidation of "<i>clamour</i> your tongues," by citing the same passage
  from Udall's <i>Apophthegmes</i>, in my <i>Vindication of the Text of
  Shakspeare</i>, p. 79. It is a pleasure which must console me for having
  subjected myself to his just animadversion on another occasion. If those
  who so egregiously blunder are to be spared the castigation justly
  merited, we see by late occurrences to what it may lead; and your
  correspondent, in my judgment, is conferring a favour on all true lovers
  of our great poet by exposing pretension and error, from whatever quarter
  it may come,&mdash;a duty which has been sadly neglected in some late
  partial reviews of <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span>'s "clever"
  corrector. <span class="sc">Mr. Arrowsmith</span>'s communications have
  been so truly <i>ad rem</i>, that I think I shall be expressing the
  sentiments of all your readers interested in such <!-- Page 4 --><span

<h3>ON THE PASSAGE FROM "KING LEAR."</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 592.)</p>

  <p>Will you allow me to suggest to your ingenious Leeds correspondent
  (whose communications would be read with only the more pleasure if they
  evinced a little more respect for the opinions of others) that before he
  asserts the existence of a certain error which he points out in a passage
  in <i>King Lear</i> to be "undeniable," it would be desirable that he
  should support this improved reading by other passages from Shakspeare,
  or from cotemporary writers, in which the word he proposes occurs? For my
  own part, I think A.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B.'s suggestion well worthy of consideration, but
  I cannot admit that it "demonstrates itself," or "that any attempt to
  support it by argument would be absurd," for it would unquestionably
  strengthen his case to show that the verb "recuse" was not entirely
  obsolete in Shakspeare's time. Neither can I admit that there is an
  "obvious opposition between <i>means</i> and <i>defects</i>," the two
  words having no relation to each other. The question is, which of two
  words must be altered; and at present I must own I am inclined to put
  more faith in the authority of "the old corrector" than in A.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B.</p>

  <p>Having taken up my pen on this subject, allow me to remark upon the
  manner in which <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span>'s folio is referred
  to by your correspondent. I have carefully considered many of the
  emendations proposed, and feel in my own mind satisfied that <i>so great
  a number</i> that, in the words of your correspondent, <i>demonstrate
  themselves</i>, could not have been otherwise than adopted from some
  authority. Even in the instance of the passage from Henry V., "on a table
  of green friese," which A.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. selects, I presume, as being especially
  absurd, I think "the old corrector" right; although I had frequently
  cited Theobald's correction as particularly happy, and therefore the new
  version was at first to me very distasteful. But, whatever opinion may be
  held as to the value of the book, it is surely unbecoming to the
  discussion of a literary question to indulge in the unsparing
  insinuations that have been thrown out on all sides respecting it. I
  leave out of question the circumstance, that the long and great services
  of <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> ought to protect him at least from
  such unworthy treatment.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Samuel Hickson.</span></p>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;Since writing the above, I have seen <span class="sc">Mr.
  Keightley</span>'s letter. I hope he will not deprive the readers of "N.
  &amp; Q." of the benefit of his valuable communications for the offences
  of one or two. He might consider, first, that his own dignity would
  suffer least by letting them pass by him "as the idle wind;" and,
  secondly, that some allowance should be made for gentlemen who engage in
  controversy on a subject which, strangely enough, next to religion, seems
  to be most productive of discord.</p>

  <p class="author">S. H.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"I have no way, and therefore want no eyes;</p>
      <p>I stumbled when I saw. Full oft 'tis seen</p>
      <p>Our means <i>secure</i> us; and our mere defects</p>
      <p>Prove our commodities."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Does not Shakspeare here use <i>secure</i> as a verb, in the sense "to
  make careless?" If so, the passage would mean, "Our means," that is, our
  power, our strength, make us wanting in care and vigilance, and too
  self-confident. Gloucester says, "I stumbled when I saw;" meaning, When I
  had eyes I walked carelessly; when I had the "means" of seeing and
  avoiding stumbling-blocks, I stumbled and fell, because I walked without
  care and watchfulness. Then he adds, "And our mere defects prove our
  commodities." Our deficiencies, our weaknesses (the sense of them), make
  us use such care and exertions as to prove advantages to us. Thus the
  antithesis is preserved.</p>

  <p>How scriptural is the first part of the passage!</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall."&mdash;1
  Cor. x. 12.</p>

  <p>"He hath said in his heart, Tush, I shall never be cast down; there
  shall no harm happen unto me."&mdash;Ps. x. 6.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The second part is also scriptural:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"My strength is made perfect in weakness."&mdash;2 Cor. xii. 9.</p>

  <p>"When I am weak then am I strong."&mdash;2 Cor. xii. 10.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In <i>Timon of Athens</i> we find <i>secure</i> used as verb
  "<i>Secure</i> thy heart."&mdash;Act II. Sc. 2.</p>

  <p>Again, in <i>Othello</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I do not so <i>secure</i> me in the error."&mdash;Act I. Sc. 3.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In Du Cange's <i>Gloss.</i> is the verb "<i>Securare</i> nudè pro
  securum reddere." In the "Alter Index sive Glossarium" of Ainsworth's
  <i>Dictionary</i> is the verb "<i>Securo</i>, as ... to live carelessly."
  In the "Verba partim Græca Latinè scripta, partim barbara," &amp;c., is
  "<i>Securo</i>, as securum reddo."</p>

  <p>The <i>means</i> of the hare in the fable for the race (that is, her
  swiftness) <i>secured</i> her; the defects of the tortoise (her slowness)
  proved her <i>commodity</i>.</p>

<h3>MANNERS OF THE IRISH.</h3>

  <p>The following are extracts from a MS. volume of the sixteenth century,
  containing, <i>inter alia</i>, notes of the Manners and Superstitions of
  the <!-- Page 5 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  to elucidate the obscure references:</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p><i>Deo gracias is smar in Doieagh</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The next appears to be a scrap of a woman's song:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Birch and keyre 'tis wal veyre a spyunyng deye a towme.</p>

      <p>Justice Deyruse in my lopp, and senscal in my roame," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>John Devereux was Justiciary of the Palatinate Liberty of Wexford in
  the early part of Henry VIII.'s reign. That Palatinate was then governed
  by a seneschal or "senscal." The justice would seem to have been a
  gallant and <i>sensual</i> man, and the song may have been a little
  satirical. Among the notes of the "Manners" of the Irish, it is declared
  that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Sett them a farme&mdash;the grandfather, father, son, and they clayme
  it as their own: if not, they goe to rebellion."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Will any antiquary versed in Celtic customs explain whether this claim
  of possession grew out of any Celtic usage of tenancy? And also point out
  authorities bearing upon the customs of Celtic agricultural tenancy?</p>

  <p>The next extract bears upon the communication at Vol. vii., p.
  332.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"An <i>Ultagh</i> hath three purses. He runneth behind dore to draw
  his money: one cutteth the throte of another."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Now, was an <i>Ultagh</i> an Irish usurer or money-lender? Your
  correspondent at page 332. requests information respecting Roger Outlaw.
  Sir William Betham, in a note to the "Proceedings against Dame Alice
  Ugteler," the famous pseudo-Kilkenny witch, remarks that "the family of
  Utlagh were seated in Dublin, and filled several situations in the
  corporation." Utlagh and Outlaw are the same surnames. The named Utlagh
  also occurs in the Calendar of Printed Irish Patent Rolls. William
  Utlagh, or Outlaw, was a <i>banker</i> and <i>money-lender</i> in
  Kilkenny, in the days of Edward I. He was the first husband of the witch,
  and brother of Friar Roger Outlaw. In favour of the latter, who was Prior
  of Kilmainham, near Dublin, a mandamus, dated 10 Edw. II., was issued for
  arrears due to him since he was "justice and chancellor, and even
  lieutenant of the justiciary, as well in the late king's time as of the
  present king's." He was appointed Lord Justice, or deputy to the Lord
  Lieutenant, by patent dated Mar. 15, 9 Edw. III.</p>

  <p>Many of the Irish records having been lost, your correspondent will do
  an obliging service in pointing out the repository of the discovered
  roll. Perhaps steps might be taken for its restoration.</p>

  <p>As for "in viiij mense," I cannot understand it: I copied it as it was
  sent to me. B. Etii was an error of the press for R. Etii, but I
  purposely avoided noticing it, because my very first communication on the
  subject to "N. &amp; Q.," under my own name and address, opened a very
  pleasing correspondence, which has since led to the restoration of these
  Irish documents to their congeners among the public records in Dublin; a
  gentleman having set out most chivalrously from that city at his own cost
  to recover them, and I am happy to say he has succeeded; and in the
  <i>English Quarterly Magazine</i> there will soon appear, I believe, an
  account of the documents in question. It would not, therefore, become me
  to give in this place the explanation which has been kindly communicated
  to me as to the meaning of the last conquest of Ireland; but I have no
  doubt it will be explained in the <i>English Quarterly</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Burial in an erect Posture.</i>&mdash;In the north transept of
  Stanton Harcourt Church, Oxon, the burial-place of the Harcourt family,
  is a circular slab of blue marble in the pavement, in which is inlaid a
  shield of brass bearing the arms of Harcourt,&mdash;two bars, dimidiated
  with those of Beke; the latter, when entire, forming a cros ancrée. The
  brass is not engraved, but forms the outline of the shield and arms. It
  is supposed to be the monument of Sir John, son of Sir Richard Harcourt
  and Margaret Beke, who died 1330. (See extracts from Lord Harcourt's
  "Account," in the <i>Oxford Architectural Guide</i>, p. 178.) Tradition
  relates, if my memory does not mislead me, that the knight was buried
  beneath this stone in an erect posture, but assigns no reason for this
  peculiarity. Is the probability of this being the case supported by any,
  and what instances? Or does the legend merely owe its existence to the
  circular form of the stone? <!-- Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page6"></a>{6}</span>I think that its diameter is about two feet.
  If <span class="sc">Mr. Fraser</span> has not met with the information
  already, he may be interested, with reference to his Query on
  "Dimidiation" (Vol. vii., p. 548.), in learning that the above mentioned
  Margaret was daughter and coheiress of John Lord Beke of Eresby, who by
  his will, made the 29th of Edw. I., devised the remainder of his arms to
  be divided between Sir Robert de Willoughby and Sir John de Harcourt. And
  this may lead to the farther Query, whether dimidiation was originally or
  universally resorted to in the case of coheiresses?</p>

  <p><i>National Methods of Applauding.</i>&mdash;Clapping with the hands

  taking its place. When Mr. Combe was lecturing on phrenology at the
  Museum building in Philadelphia twelve or thirteen years ago, he and his
  auditors were much annoyed by the <i>pedal</i> applause of a company in
  the room above, who were listening to the concerts of a negro band.
  Complaint was made to the authorities of the Museum Society; but the
  answer was, that nothing could be done, as stamping of the feet was "the
  national method of applauding."</p>

  <p>The crying of "hear him! hear him!" during the delivery of a speech,
  is not in use in the United States, as an English gentleman discovered
  who settled here a few years ago. He attended a meeting of the members of
  the church to which he had attached himself, and hearing something said
  that pleased him, he cried out "hear him! hear him!" Upon which the
  sexton came over to him, and told him that, unless he kept himself quiet,
  he would be under the necessity of turning him out of church.</p>

  <p><i>Curious Posthumous Occurrence.</i>&mdash;If the following be true,

  in the bodies of Bath people! But if the face turns down in any instance,

  of a family had been buried some years since, and which lay in very wet
  ground, I observed that the upper part of the coffin was rotted away, and
  had left the head and bones of the skull exposed to view. On inquiring of
  the grave-digger how it came to pass that I did not observe the usual
  sockets of the eyes in the skull, he replied that what I saw was the hind
  part of the head (termed the <i>occiput</i>, I believe, by anatomists),
  and that the face was turned, as usual, to the earth!!&mdash;Not exactly
  understanding his phrase 'as usual,' I inquired if the body had been
  buried with the face upwards, as in the ordinary way; to which he replied
  to my astonishment, in the affirmative, adding, that in the course of
  decomposition the face of every individual turns to the earth!! and that,
  in the experience of three-and-twenty years in his situation, he had
  never known more than one instance to the contrary.'"</p>

<h3>DID CAPTAIN COOK FIRST DISCOVER THE SANDWICH ISLANDS?</h3>

  <p>In a French atlas, dated 1762, in my possession, amongst the numerous
  non-existing islands laid down in the map of the Pacific, and the still
  more numerous cases of omission inevitable at so early a period of
  Polynesian discovery, there is inserted an island styled "I. St.
  François," or "I.&nbsp;S. Francisco," which lies in <!-- Page 7 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page7"></a>{7}</span>about 20° N. and 224° E.
  from the meridian of Ferro, and, of course, almost exactly in the
  situation of Owhyhee. That this large and lofty group may have been seen
  by some other voyager long before, is far from improbable; but, beyond a
  question, Cooke was the first to visit, describe, and lay them down
  correctly in our maps. Professor Meyen, however, as quoted in Johnston's
  <i>Physical Atlas</i>, mentions these islands in terms which would almost
  lead one to suppose that he, the Professor, considered them to have been
  known to the Spaniards in Anson's time or earlier, and that they had been
  regular calling places for the galleons in those days! It is difficult to
  conceive such a man capable of such a mistake; but if he did not suppose
  them to have been discovered before Cook's voyage in 1778, his words are
  singularly calculated to deceive the reader on that point.</p>

<h3>SUPERSTITION OF THE CORNISH MINERS.</h3>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Kingsley</span> records a superstition of the
  Cornish miners, which I have not seen noted elsewhere. In reply to the
  question, "What are the <i>Knockers</i>?" Tregarva answers:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"They are <i>the ghosts</i>, the miners hold, <i>of the Old Jews that
  crucified our Lord, and were sent for slaves by the Roman emperors to
  work the mines</i>: and we find their old smelting-houses, which we call
  <i>Jews' houses</i>, and their blocks of the bottom of the great bogs,
  which we call <i>Jews' tin</i>: and then, a town among us, too, which we
  call <i>Market Jew</i>, but the old name was <i>Marazion</i>, that means
  the Bitterness of Zion, they tell me; and bitter work it was for them no
  doubt, poor souls! We used to break into the old shafts and adits which
  they had made, and find old stags-horn pickaxes, that crumbled to pieces
  when we brought them to grass. And they say that if a man will listen of
  a still night about those old shafts, he may hear the ghosts of them at
  working, knocking, and picking, as clear as if there was a man at work in
  the next level."&mdash;<i>Yeast; a Problem</i>: Lond. 1851, p. 255.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Miners, as a class, are peculiarly susceptible of impressions of the
  unseen world, and the superstitions entertained by them in different
  parts of the world would form a curious volume. Is there any work on
  Cornish folk lore which alludes to this superstition respecting the Jews?
  It would be useless, I dare say, to consult Carew, or Borlase; besides, I
  have not them by me.</p>

  <p>Anton Wilhelm Böhme, who came over as chaplain with Prince George of
  Denmark, officiated at the German Chapel, St. James's, from the year 1705
  to 1722. He was a favourite of Queen Anne, and a friend of Isaac Watts.
  On one occasion he preached against adultery in a way which gave great
  offence to one of the courtiers present, who conceived that a personal
  attack on himself was intended. He accordingly sent a challenge to the
  preacher, which was without hesitation accepted; and at the time and
  place appointed the chaplain made his appearance in full canonicals, with
  his Bible in his hand, and gave the challenger a lecture which led to
  their reconciliation and friendship.</p>

  <p>I do not remember to have read any account of the battle; but, as I
  have heard from the lips of one who gained his information from the
  officer before alluded to, the particulars were these:&mdash;General
  Mansell, with a force consisting of two squadrons of the 15th Hussars,
  and one squadron of the German Legion, <i>two hundred and seventy-two</i>
  in all, charged a body of the French army, <i>ten thousand</i> strong.
  The French were formed in a hollow square: but five times, as I am
  informed, did our gallant troops charge into and out of the square, till
  the French, struck with a sudden panic, retreated with a loss of twelve
  hundred men. I am desirous of authenticating this almost incredible

  the mummies of Egypt, in which the art of embalming bodies is so
  eminently displayed, that all attempts at imitation have only showed the
  infinite superiority of the original to the copy. I need not appeal to
  the gilding upon those mummies so fresh in its lustre; to the stained
  silk of them, so vivid in its colours after a lapse of 3000 years; to the
  ductility and malleability of glass, discovered by an artist of Rome in
  the days of Tiberius, but instantly lost by the immediate murder of the
  man under the orders of the emperor, and just now boasted vainly to be
  re-discovered by the wildly eccentric, yet vividly vigorous, genius of
  that earl who professes to teach law to my lord chancellor, and divinity
  to my lords the <!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  burning-glasses of Archimedes, recorded in their effects by credible
  writers, actually imitated by Proclus at the siege of Constantinople with
  Archimedes' own success, yet boldly pronounced by some of our best

<h3>BISHOP KEN.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 526.)</p>

  <p>By converting a noun into a surname, Dodsley has led J.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;J. into a
  natural, but somewhat amusing mistake. The lines quoted are in Horace
  Walpole's well-known epistle, from Florence, addressed to his college
  friend T[homas] A[shton,] tutor of the Earl of P[lymouth].</p>

  <p>In Walpole's <i>Fugitive Pieces</i>, printed at Strawberry Hill, 1758
  (the copy of which, now before me, was given by Walpole to Cole in 1762,
  and contains several notes by the latter), the passage stands correctly
  thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Or, with wise ken, judiciously define,</p>
      <p>When Pius marks the honorary coin,</p>
      <p>Of Carnealla, or of Antonine."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Your correspondent refers to an edition of the <i>Collection of
  Poems</i> of 1758. In a much later edition of that work, viz. 1782, the
  line is again printed&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Or with wise <span class="scac">KEN</span>," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It is strange that the mistake was not corrected, at the instance of
  Walpole himself, during this long interval.</p>

  <p>Turning to Bishop Ken, I would observe that in his excellent Life of
  this prelate, Mr. Anderdon has given the three well-known hymns "word for
  word," as first penned. These, Mr. A. tells us, are found, for the first
  time, in a copy of the <i>Manual of Prayers For the Use of the Winchester
  Scholars</i>, printed in 1700. The bishop's versions vary so very
  materially from those to which we have been accustomed from childhood,
  that these original copies are very interesting. Indeed, within five
  years after their first appearance, and during the author's life,
  material changes were made, several of which are retained to the present
  hour. It must be admitted that some of the stanzas, as they first came
  from the bishop's pen, are singularly rugged and inharmonious, almost
  justifying the request made by the lady to Byrom (as I have stated
  elsewhere<a name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>),
  "to revise and polish the bishop's poems." How came these hymns, so far
  the most popular of his poetical works, to be omitted by Hawkins in the
  collected edition of the poems, printed in 4 vols., 1721?</p>

  <p>My present object is, to call your attention to a "Midnight Hymn," by
  Sir Thomas Browne, which will be found in his works (vol. ii. p. 113.,
  edit. Wilkin). Can there be question that to it Ken is indebted for some
  of the thoughts and expressions in two of his own hymns?</p>

  <p>The good bishop's fame will not be lessened by his adopting what was
  good in the works of the learned physician. He doubtless thought far more
  of the benefit which he could render to the youthful Wykehamists, than of
  either the originality or smoothness of his own verses.</p>

<h3>BOHN'S EDITION OF HOVEDEN.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 579.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Riley</span> mistakes my purpose if he thinks
  that my object was to make a personal attack on him; and for anything in
  my last communication which may have appeared to possess that tendency, I
  hereby freely express my regret. Still I cannot allow that he has
  explained away the mistakes of which I complained, and of which I still
  have to complain. The kingdom of Cork <i>never</i> "extended to within a
  short distance of Waterford;" and the territory of Desmond was
  <i>never</i> co-extensive with Cork, having been always confined to the
  county of Kerry. <span class="sc">Mr. Riley</span>, therefore, is in
  error when he uses "Cork" and "Desmond" as synonymous. Again, he falls
  into the same mistake by assuming "Crook, Hook Point, or The Crook," to
  be synonyms. I never heard that Henry II. landed at Hook Point, which is
  in the county of Wexford, and from which a land journey to Waterford
  would be very circuitous. At Crook, however, on the opposite side of
  Waterford Harbour, and within the shelter of Creden Head, he is said to
  have done so; and as that point answers pretty exactly to the
  <i>Crock</i> of Hoveden, why assume some indefinite point of the "Kingdom
  of Cork" as the locality, even supposing that its boundary <i>did</i>
  approach Waterford city? Really <span class="sc">Mr. Riley</span>'s
  explanations but make matters worse.</p>

  <p>With regard to "Erupolensis" being an <i>alias</i> of Ossoriensis, I
  may quote the authority of the learned De Burgo, who, speaking of the
  diocese of Ossory, observes:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Quandoque tamen nuncupata erat <i>Eyrupolensis</i> ab <i>Eyro</i>
  Flumine, vulgò <i>Neoro</i>, quod <i>Kilkenniam</i>
  alluit."&mdash;<i>Hibernia Dominicana</i>, p. 205. note <i>i</i>.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I maintain that the reading public has just cause to complain, not (as
  I said on a former occasion) because the editor of such a book as
  Hoveden's <i>Annals</i> does not know everything necessary to elucidate
  his author, but because baseless conjectures are put forward as
  elucidations of the text.</p>

<h3>COLERIDGE'S CHRISTABEL.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., pp. 206. 292.)</p>

  <p>It is difficult to believe that the third part of <i>Christabel</i>,
  published in Blackwood for June, 1819, vol. v. p. 286., could have either
  "perplexed the public," or "pleased Coleridge." In the first place, it
  was avowedly written by "Morgan Odoherty;" and in the next, it is too
  palpable a parody to have pleased the original author, who could hardly
  have been satisfied with the raving rhapsodies put into his mouth, or
  with the treatment of his innocent and virtuous heroine. This will
  readily be supposed when it is known that the Lady Geraldine is made out
  to have been a man in woman's attire, and that "the mark of Christabel's
  shame, the seal of her sorrow," is neither more nor less than the natural
  consequence of her having shared her chamber with such a visitor.</p>

  <p>Is your correspondent A. B. R. correct in stating this parody to have
  been the composition of Dr. Maginn? In the biography of this brilliant
  writer in the twenty-third volume of the <i>Dublin University
  Magazine</i>, Dr. Moir, who had undoubtedly good opportunities of
  knowing, mentions that his first contribution to <i>Blackwood</i> was the
  Latin translation of "Chevy Chase," in the number for November 1819; if
  this be correct, many of the cleverest papers that appeared under the
  name of Odoherty, and which are all popularly attributed <!-- Page 12
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"></a>{12}</span>to Maginn, must
  have been the work of other authors, a circumstance which I had been
  already led to suspect from the frequent local allusions to Scotland in
  general, and to Edinburgh in particular, which could have scarcely
  proceeded from the pen of a native of Cork, who had then never visited
  Scotland. Since Dr. Moir's own death, it appears that the <i>Eve of St.
  Jerry</i>, and the <i>Rhyme of the Auncient Waggonere</i>, have been
  claimed for him, as well as some other similar pieces; and I believe that
  the series of <i>Boxiana</i>, which also appeared under the name of the
  renowned ensign and adjutant, was written by Professor Wilson. Maginn's
  contributions were at first under various signatures, and some time
  elapsed before he made use of the <i>nom de guerre</i> of Morgan
  Odoherty, which eventually became so identified with him.</p>

<h3>ITS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 578.)</p>

  <p>I am sorry to intrude upon your valuable space again in reference to
  this little word, but the inquiry of <span class="sc">Mr. Rye</span> (p.
  578.), and other reasons, render it desirable. The truth is that <span
  class="sc">Mr. Keightley</span>, <span class="sc">Mr. Rye</span> and
  myself, are more or less mistaken. 1. <span class="sc">Mr.
  Keightley</span>, in his quotation from Fairfax's <i>Tasso</i> (<span
  class="sc">Mr. Singer</span>'s accurate reprint, 1817), has <i>his</i> in
  both lines. 2. <span class="sc">Mr. Rye</span>, in understanding me to
  refer to any translation proper; unless Sternhold and Hopkins are to be
  considered as having produced one. 3. Myself, in supposing the old
  metrical version in the Book of Common Prayer originally had the word
  <i>its</i>. I copied from the Oxford edition in fol. of 1770; but a 4to.
  edition, "printed by Iohn Daye, dwelling over Aldersgate, anno 1574,"
  does not exhibit the word in the places specified; we have instead
  <i>her</i> in both places.</p>

  <p>Hitherto, then, the oldest examples of the use of this word have been
  adduced from Shakspeare. These are to be found in the first folio, but
  are in each case printed with the apostrophe after the
  <i>t</i>,&mdash;<i>it's</i>. This method of writing the word, however,
  soon disappeared, for in a treatise of Pemble's, printed 1635 (the author
  died in 1623), it appears as we write it now:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"If faith alone by <i>its</i> own virtue and
  force."&mdash;<i>Works</i>, fol. p. 171.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I have not observed the fact remarked, that besides the use of <i>his,
  her, hereof, thereof, of it</i>, and <i>the</i>, it was customary to
  employ the unchanged word <i>it</i> for the possessive case. I will give
  an example or two. In the Genevan version, at Rom. viii. 20., we read
  "Not of <i>it</i> owne wille." This passage is thus quoted in 1611 and in
  1622, but in a later edition of the same work, 1656, <i>its</i> is
  substituted for <i>it</i>. I have a note of one other instance from
  Perkins on Rev. ii. 28. (ed. 1606): "For as the sunne in the spring time
  quickeneth by <i>it</i> warme beames."</p>

  <p>In conclusion, may I request that if any genuine instance of the use
  of this word <i>its</i>, is observed by any of your many contributors,
  they will communicate the fact to you? At present we can only go back to
  Shakspeare, in his <i>Winter's Tale</i> and <i>Henry VIII</i>.</p>

<h3>FAMILY OF MILTON'S WIDOW.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 596.)</p>

  <p>As your correspondent <span class="sc">Cranmore</span> has long been a
  deserter from the ranks of "N. &amp; Q.," I may perhaps, without
  presumption, for once "stand in his shoes," and reply to the challenge
  addressed to him by V.&nbsp;M.</p>

  <p>Much obscurity has all along prevailed among the many biographers of
  Milton, in reference to the family of Elizabeth Minshull, his third wife,
  and eventually, for more than fifty years, his widow. Philips, Warton,
  Todd, and numerous others, state her to have been "the daughter of Mr.
  Minshull, of Cheshire,"&mdash;a very vague assertion when we consider
  that there were at least three or four different families of that name
  then existing in the county. Pennant, who delighted in particularities,
  sometimes even at the expense of historical fact, tells us, for the first
  time, in 1782, that she was the daughter of Mr. (or Sir) Edward Minshull,
  of Stoke, near Nantwich, and that she died at the latter town in March,
  1726, at an advanced age. Mr. Ormerod, again, whose splendid <i>History
  of Cheshire</i> will be the standard authority of the county for ages
  after he himself is carried to his fathers, has unfortunately adopted the
  same conclusion, and so given a colour, as it were, to this erroneous
  statement of our Cambrian antiquary. The Rev. Benjamin Mardon's paper,
  printed in the <i>Journal of the British Archæological Association for
  1849</i>, is another and more recent instance of the way in which such
  errors as this may become perpetuated. Another writer (Palmer)
  conjectures her to have been the daughter of Minshull of Manchester; but
  this also has been proved to be entirely destitute of foundation.</p>

  <p>The truth of the matter is (and I am indebted to Mr. Fitchett Marsh's
  clear and succinct dissertation in the <i>Miscellany</i> of the Chetham
  Society for the information), the poet's widow was daughter of Mr. Randle
  Minshull, of Wistaston in the county of Chester, whose
  great-great-grandfather, a younger son of Minshull of Minshull, settled
  on a small estate there in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and so founded
  the house of Minshull of Wistaston. Milton was introduced to his Cheshire
  wife by his friend Dr. Paget; and <!-- Page 13 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page13"></a>{13}</span>it was by his advice that
  the author of <i>Paradise Lost</i> once more entered into the bonds of
  wedlock. Mr. Marsh, to clear up all doubt upon the subject, and having
  previously established the identity of the family, examined the parish
  register at Wistaston, and there found that "Elizabeth, the daughter of
  Randolph Mynshull, was baptized the 30th day of December, 1638;" so that,
  if baptized shortly after birth, she must have been about twenty-six
  years old when united to Milton in 1664, and about eighty-nine at her
  death, which occurred in 1727.</p>

  <p>V. M., and all others who desire farther enlightenment on the subject,
  will do well to refer to the volume before mentioned, which forms the
  twenty-fourth of the series published by the Chetham Society.</p>

<h3>BOOKS OF EMBLEMS&mdash;JACOB BEHMEN.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., pp. 469. 579.)</p>

  <p>Perhaps you will allow poor old Jacob Behmen, the inspired cobbler of
  Gorlitz, a niche in your temple of writers of emblems. I think he is
  legitimately entitled to that distinction. His works are nearly all
  couched in emblems; and, besides his own figures, his principles were
  pictorially illustrated by his disciple William Law (the author of <i>The
  Way to Divine Knowledge</i>, <i>The Serious Call</i>, &amp;c.), in some
  seventeen simple, and four compound emblematic drawings. Of these the
  most remarkable, and in fact the most intelligible, are three compound
  emblems representing the Creation, Apostasy, and Redemption of Man. Every
  phase of each stage in the soul's history is disclosed to view by means
  of double and single doors. We are now concerned only with such of
  Behmen's emblematic works as have been translated into English. The
  following list contains only those in my own library. I am acquainted
  with no others:</p>

  <p>(1.) "The Works of Jacob Behmen, the Teutonic Theosopher, to which is
  prefixed the Life of the Author, with Figures illustrating his

  class="scac">MDCCLXIV</span>." With a fine portrait of Behmen facing the
  title-page of the first volume. This edition contains the following
  works:</p>

<h3>RAFFAELLE'S SPOSALIZIO.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 595.)</p>

  <p>With regard to your correspondent <span class="sc">Mr. G. Brindley
  Ackworth</span>'s Query respecting <i>Raffaelle's Sposalizio</i>, I am
  induced to think that the <i>custode</i> at the church of the Santa Croce
  at Florence was right as to his information. In the copy which I have of
  the "Ordo ad faciendum Sponsalia," <i>according to the ancient use of
  Salisbury</i>, the ring is undoubtedly to be placed on the bride's
  <i>right</i> hand. Wheatly indeed says, that "when the man espouses his
  wife with it (<i>i.e.</i> the ring), he is to put it <i>upon the fourth
  finger of her</i> left <i>hand</i>;" and then refers, for <i>the
  reason</i> of this, to the rubric of <i>Salisbury Manual</i>, which
  speaks of the vein going from this finger directly to the heart.</p>

  <p>Now, what are the precise words of this rubric? After giving
  directions for the benediction of the ring, provided it has not
  previously been blessed, the rubric goes on thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Si autem antea fuerit annulus ille benedictus tunc statim postquam
  vir posuerit annulum super librum, accipiens sacerdos annulum tradat
  ipsum viro: quem vir accipiat manu sua dextera cum tribus <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads `principalionibus'."
  >principalioribus</span> digitis, et manu sua sinistra tenens dexteram
  sponsæ docente sacerdote dicat."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The man is to receive the ring from the priest with the three
  principal fingers of the right hand; and then, holding the <i>right
  hand</i> of the bride with his own left hand, he shall say, "With this
  ring," &amp;c. He is then to place the ring on her thumb, saying, "In
  nomine Patris;" then on her second finger, saying "et Filii;" then on the
  third finger, saying "et Spiritus Sancti;" then on the fourth finger,
  saying "Amen;" and there he is to leave it. There is not a word said
  about the bride's <i>left</i> hand, the <i>right</i> is alone mentioned;
  and why should the man hold her <i>right</i> hand with his <i>left</i>,
  but that with his <i>right</i> hand he may the more easily place the
  ring, <i>first</i> on the <i>thumb</i>, then on the other fingers of her
  <i>right</i> hand, until it arrives at its ideal destination?</p>

  <p>While I am upon this subject, allow me to point out another singular
  direction given in a rubric in this same "Ordo ad faciendum Sponsalia."
  When the woman is, as we term it, given away, if she be a spinster, she
  is to have her hand <i>uncovered</i>; if a widow, <i>covered</i>: the
  words are&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Deinde detur femina a patre suo, vel ab amicis ejus: quod si
  <i>puella</i> sit, <i>discoopertam</i> habeat <i>manum</i>, si
  <i>vidua</i>, <i>tectam</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There is no reason given for this distinction, nor do I ever remember
  to have seen it noticed.</p>

  <p class="author">F. B. W.</p>

  <p>The <i>Sposalizio</i>, or "espousals," or betrothing, is certainly a
  different ceremony from the marriage. Is not the fact of young ladies
  popularly considering and calling the third finger of the <i>right</i>
  hand the engaged finger, and wearing a ring on that finger when engaged,
  a confirmation of your correspondent's idea, that at this "betrothal" or
  "espousals" (compare the phrase "his espoused wife" of Mary before her
  <i>marriage</i> with Joseph) the ring was placed in the <i>right</i>
  hand; at the marriage ceremony on the left?</p>

<h3>WINDFALL.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 285.)</p>

  <p>W. W. is desirous of interpreting <i>windfall</i>, as necessarily from
  its origin denoting a gain. He is, perhaps, expecting a handsome bequest;
  I wish he may get it; but he may rely on it that the <i>windfall</i> of
  the bequest will be accompanied by the <i>windfall</i> of the "Succession
  Act." Let us hear what our great Doctor says; his first explanation is,
  "Fruit blown down from the tree."</p>

  <p>W. W.'s little boys and girls would deem a <i>windfall</i> of unripe
  apples, at this time of the year, a good; they will make a pie for
  dinner. W.&nbsp;W. himself would call it an evil; the ripe crop is ruined.</p>

  <p>But let us see how Johnson illustrates his explanation:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Their <i>boughs</i> were too great for their stem, they became a
  <i>windfall</i> upon the sudden."&mdash;<i>Bacon</i>, Essay 29.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Webster copies this for his first explanation, as he does also our
  Dr's. second for his second; but as it is not his plan to illustrate by
  examples, he is saved from the <i>eccentricity</i> of his original.</p>

  <p>If we refer to Bacon we shall be reminded of Johnson's warning, that
  by "hasty detruncation the general tendency of a sentence may be
  changed." The sentence here so hastily detruncated, stands thus in the
  Essay:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Spartans were a nice people in point of naturalisation, whereby
  while they kept their compasse, they stood firme. But when <i>they</i>
  did spread, and <i>their boughes</i> were becommen too great for their
  stemme, they became a <i>windfall</i> upon the suddaine. 'Potentia eorum
  subito corruit.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>They</i>, in Johnson's mutilated sentence, refers to the
  <i>boughs</i>; in Bacon, to the Spartans; so that, in <!-- Page 15
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"></a>{15}</span>the first place,
  the Spartans are transformed into boughs, and, in the next place, the
  boughs into fruit. Detruncation, however, had nothing to do with this
  latter metamorphosis; and I am afraid this is not a solitary instance of
  lexicographical incongruity.</p>

  <p>W. W. may assure himself that a windfall is "whatever <i>falls</i> by
  the wind, or with similar suddenness or unexpectedness, whether bringing
  good or ill."</p>

  <p>And if he will take the trouble to refer to "The Case of Impeachment
  of Waste," quoted by <span class="sc">Mr. Arrowsmith</span>, Vol. vii.,
  p. 375., he will find, only a few lines before that gentleman's quotation
  begins, a legal question at issue as to the right of property in
  <i>windfalls</i>.</p>

<h3>MR. JUSTICE NEWTON.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., pp. 528. 600.)</p>

  <p>It would greatly enhance the value of contributions to "N. &amp; Q.,"
  save much trouble, and often lead to a more direct intercourse between
  persons of similar pursuits, if contributors would drop initials, and
  sign their own proper name and <i>habitat</i>; and in saying this, I
  believe the Editor will second me. If C.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;G. had done this, I should
  have been happy to send him an envelope full of proofs that Mr. Justice
  Newton did not die in 1444, for that a fine was levied before him in
  1448; that he is not buried in Bristol Cathedral, but in the Wyke Aisle
  in Yatton Church, Somerset, where may be seen his effigies beautifully
  carved in alabaster, in his judge's robes, and his head resting on a
  wheat-sheaf or garb; that there was <i>no</i> relationship between the
  second baronet of Hather, his arms being <i>cross bones</i>, &amp;c., and
  those of the judge, who was truly a <i>Cradock</i>, were three garbs,
  &amp;c. I would now beg leave to refer C.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;G. to my former
  communications in "N. &amp; Q." about Cradock Newton, particularly Vol.
  ii., pp. 248. 427.; <i>Chronica Judicialia</i>, 1635; Foss's <i>Lives of
  the Judges</i>; and a paper of mine in the forthcoming volume of the
  <i>Proceedings of the Archæological Institute at Bristol</i>.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">H. T. Ellacombe</span>.</p>

  <p class="address">Rectory, Clyst St. George.</p>

  <p>From C. S. G.'s reply to my inquiry respecting Mr. Justice Newton I
  conclude that at least <i>two</i> individuals of this name have, at
  different periods, and at a considerable interval apart, occupied the
  judicial bench.</p>

  <p>The portrait I wish to trace is of a well-known character of the
  Commonwealth era, and could not, of course, have belonged to a judge then
  some two centuries deceased. My omission to state this circumstance, in
  the first instance, has very naturally occasioned complete
  misapprehension throughout.</p>

  <p>Since my Query was written, a duplicate of the drawing in the Bodleian
  (<i>minus</i> the inscription), out of the Strawberry Hill collection,
  has, curiously enough, appeared in an extensive public sale. It was
  likewise said to be by Bulfinch; and farther examination leads me to
  infer that both this and the Oxford copy were, in respect of artist, in
  all probability <i>not</i> incorrectly described. As Bulfinch lived
  <i>temp.</i> Charles II., and the Bodleian inscription points to his
  original painting, as "in the hands of Mr. Justice Newton," it may fairly
  be presumed that a second judge of the name flourished in this reign.</p>

  <p>Substantially, then, my original Query yet remains unanswered,
  notwithstanding C.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;G.'s obliging reply.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Mr. Lyte's Treatment of Positives.</i>&mdash;It would be quite
  superfluous, after the very excellent communication of <span
  class="sc">Mr. Pollock</span>, were I to give a detailed account of my
  method of printing albumen positives, as, in the main, we both follow the
  process of Mr. Le Gray. But as we both have our own improvements on the
  original process, I will ask for space in which to record our differences
  in manipulation.</p>

  <p>First, in regard to the chloride of gold, I always find, and I believe
  such is the experience of many photographers, that all salts of gold,
  though they heighten the effect at first, have a slow, but sure,
  destructive action on the picture.</p>

  <p>Next, I find that acetic acid, by generating sulphurous acid, has a
  similar effect, and my care was to try and make a solution which should
  be free from these defects. I first take my positive, which, as a general
  rule, I print at least half as dark again as the shade required. This
  done, I wash it well with water, and next with salt and water in the
  proportion of about half a grain per gallon, or quite a tasteless
  solution; this removes all the nitrate of silver from the paper, or if
  there is any left, the bath of salt decomposes it, leaving none in the
  texture of the paper to unite with the hypo., which otherwise forms a
  sticky substance, difficult to remove, which may be readily seen on
  looking through a positive which has been too hastily finished in the
  usual way, giving a dark shade, and a want of transparency to the lights.
  I then place the picture in a bath composed as follows:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Sodæ hyposul.              3 oz.</p>
      <p>Argent. chlorid.          70 grs.</p>
      <p>Potassii iodidi            5 grs.</p>
      <p>Pyrogallic acid            1½ to 2 grs.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The iodide of potassium I add on the same principle as <span
  class="sc">Mr. Pollock</span>'s iodide of silver, but as being <!-- Page
  16 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"></a>{16}</span>more
  convenient, as immediately on being added it decomposes some of the
  chloride of silver, and forms iodide of silver. I am happy to find that
  <span class="sc">Mr. Pollock</span> confirms me in the use of this salt;
  which I had long thought to improve the tone of my pictures. The liquid,
  which will become rapidly very dark coloured, must be set aside in an
  open vessel in a warm place for some weeks, <i>e.g.</i> till, when a
  positive is placed in it, left for a short time, and then washed with
  water, it shows clean and not mottled in the light. The solution may be
  kept always exposed, and much improves by this: if <i>much</i> used, it
  should be replenished with a simple solution of hypo. three ounces or two
  ounces to the pint; if little used, it may be filled up as much as
  evaporates with pure water.</p>

  <p>The positive is left in this solution till the required tint is
  obtained, when it is to be placed in plain hypo. two ounces to the pint,
  and in about a quarter of an hour transferred to a basin of pure water,
  and well washed in several waters. The other detail of <span
  class="sc">Mr. Pollock</span>'s process is so admirably and clearly
  given, and so like that I pursue, that I will not trouble your columns
  with it again.</p>

  <p>The after-bath of pure hypo. is not absolutely necessary; and where it
  is desired to obtain fine olive, and dark sepia, and black tints, a
  better tone results from washing well, long, and frequently, with water
  alone.</p>

  <p>This bath also gives very rich tints with paper, prepared without
  albumen: viz.&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Chloride of ammonium      5 grs.</p>
      <p>Water                     1 oz.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Lay the paper on this, and then hang it up to dry, and excite with
  ammonio-nitrate containing seventy grains of nitrate of silver to one
  ounce of water. Should the above solution not give the requisite tints
  soon after being made, add more chloride of silver; but bear in mind that
  the solution will then soon become saturated when setting positives, and
  when this occurs it must be rectified by the addition of a small portion
  of fresh hypo. alone.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">F. Maxwell Lyte.</span></p>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;I may add that I have only lately tried the addition of the
  iodide of potassium to my setting liquid, and so must qualify my
  recommendation of it by saying so.</p>

  <p><i>Stereoscopic Angles.</i>&mdash;I am obliged to <span
  class="sc">Messrs. Shadbolt</span> and <span class="sc">Wilkinson</span>
  for the information given in reply to my Queries (Vol. vii., p. 505.) My
  mode of operation is precisely that of <span class="sc">Mr.
  Wilkinson</span>: "I obtain all the information I can from every source;
  then try, and judge for myself." Hence the present letter.</p>

  <p>I regret to be obliged to differ from <span class="sc">Mr.
  Shadbolt</span>, but there is a point in his communication which appears
  to me to arise from a misconception of the stereoscopic problem. He says
  (p. 557.), "for <i>distant</i> views there is in nature scarcely any
  <i>stereoscopic</i> effect." Now, surely visual distance is merely visual
  stereosity; for, to see an object solid is merely to see its parts in
  relief, some of them appearing to project or recede from the others. It
  is the difficulty of producing this effect in landscapes, by the ordinary
  camera process, that renders views taken by such means so deficient in
  air, or, as the artists term it, aerial perspective, most distant objects
  seeming almost as near as those in the foreground. This indeed is the
  main defect of all photographs: they are true representations of nature
  to one eye&mdash;cyclopean pictures, as it were&mdash;appearing perfectly
  stereoscopic with one eye closed, but seeming absolutely flattened when
  viewed by the two eyes. I remember being shown a huge photograph of the
  city of Berlin, taken from an eminence; and a more violent caricature of
  nature I never set eyes upon. It was almost Chinese in its perspective:
  the house-tops appeared to have been mangled. It was a wonderful work of
  art, photographically considered; but artistically it was positively
  hideous. But the same defect exists in <i>all</i> monophotographic
  representations, though in a less degree, and consequently less apparent
  than in views to which a sense of distance is essential. In portraits,
  the features appear slightly flattened; and until photographers are able
  to overcome this, the chief of all obstacles to perfection, it is idle to
  talk of the art giving a correct rendering of nature. This is what is
  wanted, more than colour, diactinic lenses, multiplication of
  impressions, or anything else. And when it is remembered that the law of
  an ordinary convex lens is, the farther the object from the lens the
  nearer the focus, and, <i>vice versâ</i>, the nearer the object the
  farther the focus, it becomes evident that by such an instrument distant
  objects must be made to appear near, and near objects distant, and nature
  consequently mangled.</p>

  <p>The stereoscope gives us the only demonstrably correct representation
  of nature; and when that instrument is rendered more simple, and the
  peep-show character of the apparatus disconnected from it, the art of
  photography will transcend the productions of the painter&mdash;but not
  till then.</p>

  <p>I am anxious to obtain all the information I can from such of your
  photographic readers as are practically acquainted with the stereoscopic
  portion of the art relative to the angles under which they find it best
  to take their pictures for given distances.</p>

  <p>Mr. Fenton, the secretary of the Photographic Society, takes his
  stereoscopic pictures, when the objects are 50 feet and upwards from the
  camera, at 1 in 25. This is, as <span class="sc">Mr. Shadbolt</span>
  states, Professor Wheatstone's rule for distances. <!-- Page 17 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page17"></a>{17}</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Wilkinson</span>, on the other hand, asserts that
  3 feet in 300 yards is sufficient separation for the cameras: this is
  only 1 in 300,&mdash;a vast difference truly.</p>

  <p>"For views across the Thames," says the editor of the <i>Photographic
  Journal</i>, "the cameras should be placed 12 feet apart, and with this
  separation the effect is declared to be astonishing."</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Wilkinson</span>, however, asserts that from 4 to
  6 feet in a mile will do <i>well enough</i>!</p>

  <p>Farther, Mr. Latimer Clark (the inventor of an ingenious stereoscopic
  camera) states that with regard to the distance between the two positions
  of the cameras, he knows no good reason why the natural distance of the
  eyes, viz. 2½ inches, should be much exceeded. "A little extra relief is
  obtained," he adds, "without visible distortion, by increasing the
  separation to about 4 or 5 inches; but if this distance be greatly
  exceeded, especially for near objects (I give the gentleman's own words),
  they become apparently diminished in size, and have the appearance of
  models and dolls rather than natural objects."</p>

  <p>The reason for making the separation between the cameras greater than
  that between the two eyes, is exceedingly simple. The stereograph is to
  be looked at much <i>nearer</i> than the object itself, and consequently
  is to be seen under a much larger angle than it is viewed by the two eyes
  in nature. Hence the two pictures should be taken at the angle under
  which they are to be observed in the stereoscope. Suppose the object to
  be 50 feet distant, then of course it is seen by the two eyes under an
  angle of 2½ inches in 50 feet, or 1 in 240. But it is intended that the
  stereograph should be seen by the two eyes when but a few inches removed
  from them, or generally under an angle of 2½ in 12 inches, or nearly 1 in
  5. Hence it is self-evident that the stereoscopic angle should be
  considerably larger than that formed by the optic axes of the two eyes
  when directed to the object itself.</p>

  <p>But there is great diversity of opinion as to the extent of the angles
  requisite for producing the precise stereoscopic or distantial effect of
  nature. For myself I prefer Professor Wheatstone's rule, 1 in 25 for
  objects beyond 50 feet distant. For portraits I find the best angle 1 in
  10 when the sitter is 10 feet off, and for busts about 1 in 5 when placed
  about 5 or 6 feet from the cameras. But I should be happy to receive
  information from any of your readers concerning this important branch of
  the photographic art. For months past I have been engaged in a series of
  experiments in connexion with the subject, and wish for larger experience
  than it is possible for any single operator to acquire for himself.</p>

  <p>Mr. Fenton, I may observe, does not keep the cameras parallel in
  taking landscapes, but inclines them so that the same object may occupy
  as nearly as possible the centre of the ground glass plate.</p>

  <p>Nor is it essential that perfect horizontality or parallelism of the
  cameras should be maintained in copying trees. For buildings, however, it
  is absolutely necessary that the cameras be kept straight.</p>

  <p>I am sorry thus to trespass on your space, but being anxious, as <span
  class="sc">Mr. Wilkinson</span> says, to collect information from every
  source, and your periodical being a happy medium for conveying and
  receiving instruction, I am glad to avail myself of such a channel.</p>

  another volume compiled on the decease of Francis Cobb, Esq., the husband
  of Mrs. Cobb, and entitled, <i>Memoir of the late Francis Cobb, Esq., of

  <p>"<i>Sat cito si sat bene</i>" (Vol. vii., p. 594.).&mdash;I have not
  Twiss at hand; but I think F.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;J. is mistaken in calling it a
  "favourite maxim" of Lord Eldon. I remember to have heard Lord Eldon tell
  the story, which was, that the Newcastle Fly, in which he came up to
  town, in I forget how many days, had on its panel the motto, "Sat cito si
  sat bene:" he applied it jocularly in defence of his own habits in
  Chancery.</p>

  <p><i>Mythe versus Myth</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 326. 575.).&mdash;It gives me
  much pleasure to have afforded <span class="sc">Mr. Thiriold</span> an
  opportunity for displaying so much learning and sagacity; but I hope he
  does not imagine that he has confuted me. As I only spoke of words which,
  like <span title="muthos" class="grk"
  >&mu;&#x1FE6;&theta;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, had a single consonant
  between two vowels, such words as <i>plinth</i>, <i>labyrinth</i>,
  &amp;c. have nothing to do with the question. If <i>mythe</i>, differing
  from the other examples which are to be found, happens to have <i>the</i>
  for its termination, and thus resembles words of Anglo-Saxon origin, I
  cannot help it, but it was formed <i>secundum artem</i>. As to <span
  class="sc">Mr. Theriold</span>'s <i>m&#x233;th</i>, unless so written and
  printed, it will always be pronounced <i>m&#x45E;th</i>, like the French
  <i>mythe</i>.</p>

  <p>As to the <i>hybrid</i> adjectives, I only wished to avoid increasing
  the number of them. The French, I believe, have only one, <i>musical</i>;
  for though, like ourselves, they have made substantives of the Greek
  <span title="mousikê" class="grk"
  >&mu;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigma;&iota;&kappa;&#x1F75;</span> (sc. <span
  title="technê" class="grk">&tau;&#x1F73;&chi;&nu;&eta;</span>), <span
  title="phusikê" class="grk"
  >&phi;&upsilon;&sigma;&iota;&kappa;&#x1F75;</span>, &amp;c., in all other
  cases they retain the Greek form of the adjective, as in <i>physique</i>,
  substantive and adjective, while we generally have pairs of adjectives,
  as <i>philosophic, philosophical</i>; <i>extatic, extatical</i>; &amp;c.
  Some may think this an advantage; I do not.</p>

  <p><i>The Gilbert Family</i> (Vol. vii., p. 259).&mdash;If your
  correspondent seeking genealogical information in reference to my
  ancestors, calls on me, I will show him a presentation copy of <i>A
  Genealogical Memoir of the Gilbert Family in Old and New England</i>, by
  J.&nbsp;W. Thornton, LL.B., Boston, U.&nbsp;S., 1850, 8vo. pp. 24, only fifty

  <p><i>Alexander Clark</i> (Vol. vii., p. 580.).&mdash;I should feel
  obliged if J.&nbsp;O. could find leisure to communicate to "N. &amp; Q." some
  particulars relative to Clark. He is supposed to have been the author of
  a curious poem: <i>The Institution and Progress of the Buttery College of
  Slains, in the Parish of Cruden, Aberdeenshire; with a Catalogue of the
  Books and MSS. in the Library of that University</i>: Aberdeen, 1700. Mr.
  Peter Buchan thus mentions him in his <i>Gleanings of Scarce Old
  Ballads</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Clark, a drunken dominie at Slains, author of a poetical dialogue
  between the gardeners and tailors on the origin of their crafts, and a
  most curious Latin and English poem called the 'Buttery College of
  Slains,' which resembled much in language and style Drummond of
  Hawthornden's 'Polemo Middino.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This poem is printed in Watson's <i>Collection of Scottish Poems</i>,
  Edin. 1711; and also noticed in the <i>Edinburgh Topographical and
  Antiquarian Magazine</i>, 1848, last page. I am anxious to ascertain if
  the emblem writer, and the burlesque poet, be one and the same person.
  The dates, I confess, are somewhat against this conclusion; but there may
  have been a previous edition of the <i>Emblematical Representation</i>
  (1779). The <i>University</i> Clark is supposed to have been an
  Aberdeenshire man. Possibly J.&nbsp;O. may be able to throw some light on the
  subject.</p>

  eighteen mortal pages (42-59), which, in my musical ignorance, I humbly

  <p><i>Wooden Tombs and Effigies</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 528. 607.).&mdash;In
  a chapel adjoining the church of Heveningham in Suffolk, are (or rather
  were in 1832) the remains of a good altar tomb, with recumbent effigies
  carved in chesnut, of a knight and his lady: it appeared to be, from the
  armour and architecture, of the early part of the fifteenth century; and
  from the arms, <i>Quarterly or and gules within a border engrailed sable,
  charged with escallops argent</i>, no doubt belonged to the ancient
  family of Heveningham of that place; probably Sir John Heveningham,
  knight of the shire for the county of Suffolk in the 1st of Henry IV.</p>

  <p>When I visited this tomb in 1832, it was in a most dilapidated
  condition: the slab on which the effigy of the knight once rested was
  broken in; within the head of the lady, which was separated from the
  body, a thrush had built its nest: notwithstanding, however, the neglect
  and damp to which the chapel was exposed, these chesnut effigies remained
  wonderfully sound and perfect.</p>

  on an animal: over the armour is a surcoat; the helmet is close fitted to
  the head, his right hand is on the hilt of his sword, a shield is on the

  <p><i>Lord Clarendon and the Tubwoman</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 133. 211.
  634.).&mdash;Upon reference to the story of the "tubwoman" in p. 133., it
  will be seen that Mr. Hyde is distinctly stated to have himself married
  the brewer's widow, and to have married her for her money. It is farther
  said that Ann Hyde, the mother of Queen Mary and Queen Ann, was the only
  issue of this marriage; whereas Ann Hyde had four brothers and a sister.
  No allusion is made in this account to Sir Thomas Ailesbury. Your
  correspondent <span class="sc">Mr. Warden</span> says, that "the story
  has <i>usually</i> been told of the wife of Sir Thomas Ailesbury," and
  that it may be true of her. Will he have the kindness to furnish a
  reference to the version of the story in which Sir Thomas Ailesbury is
  said to have married the tubwoman?</p>

  <p><i>House-marks</i> (Vol. vii., p. 594.).&mdash;I do not know whether

  I cannot just now describe one accurately. Some sheep passed my house
  yesterday which were marked with a <i>cross</i> within a circle.</p>

  <p>Riding with a friend, a miller, in Essex, about thirteen years ago, he
  jumped out of the gig and over a gate, to seize a sack which was lying in
  a field. Seeing no initials upon it, I asked how he knew that it was his;
  when he pointed out to me a fish marked upon it, which he told me had
  been his own and his father's mark for many years. He also said that most
  of the millers in the neighbourhood had a peculiar <i>mark</i> (not their
  names or initials), each a different one for his own sacks.</p>

  <p><i>The Megatherium in the British Museum</i> (Vol. vii., p.
  590.).&mdash;It is much to be regretted that <span class="sc">A Foreign
  Surgeon</span> should not have examined the contents of the room which
  contains the cast of the skeleton of this animal with a little more
  attention, before he penned the above article. Had he done so, he would
  have found many of the original bones, from casts of which the restored
  skeleton has been constructed, in Wall Cases 9 and 10, and would not have
  fallen into the error of supposing that it is a <i>fac-simile</i> of the
  original skeleton at Madrid. <i>That</i> specimen was exhumed near Buenos
  Ayres in 1789; whilst our restoration <!-- Page 20 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page20"></a>{20}</span>has been made from bones
  of another individual, many of which are, as I have stated, to be found
  in the British Museum itself, and others in that of the Royal College of
  Surgeons. I are not about to defend the propriety of putting the trunk of
  a palm-tree into the claws of the Megatherium, though I do not suppose
  that the restorer ever expected, when he did so, that any one would
  entertain the idea that this gigantic beast was in the habit of climbing
  trees; but I would fain ask your correspondent on what grounds he makes
  the dogmatic assertion that "Palms there were none, at that period of
  telluric formation." I will simply remind him of the vast numbers of
  fossil fruits, and other remains of palms, in the London clay of the Isle
  of Sheppey.</p>

  <p><i>Pictorial Proverbs</i> (Vol. v., p. 559.).&mdash;Perhaps the book
  here mentioned is one of the old German <i>Narrenbuchs</i>, or <i>Book of
  Fools</i>, which were generally illustrated with pictures, of which I
  have a curious set in my possession.</p>

  <p>Can any of your correspondents give some account of the nature and
  merits of these books? Are any of them worth translating at the present
  day? The one from which my pictures were taken has the title <i>Mala
  Gallina, malum Ovum</i>, and was published at Vienna and Nuremburg. It
  seems to have been a satire on the female sex; but the text, I am sorry
  to say, is not in my possession.</p>

  <p><i>"Hurrah," and other War-cries</i> (Vol. vii., p. 596.).&mdash;The
  following passage (which I find in my notes with the reference

  correspondent <span class="sc">Cape</span>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Le cri des anciens Comtes d'Anjou étoit <i>Rallie</i>. En voici
  l'origine. Eude II., Comte de Blois, marchant avec une armée considérable
  contre Foulke Nerra, Comte d'Anjou, ces deux princes se rencontrèrent à
  Pontlevoi sur le Cher, où ils se livrèrent bataille le 6 Juillet, 1016.
  Foulke eut d'abord quelque désavantage; mais Herbert, Comte du Maine (dit
  <i>Eveillechien</i>), étant venu à son secours, il rallia ses troupes,
  and défit absolument, &amp;c. Depuis ce temps-là le cri des anciens
  Comtes d'Anjou étoit <i>Rallie</i>. Et à ce propos je vous rapporterai ce

  <p>The following extracts from Sir Francis Palgrave's <i>History of
  Normandy and England</i>, vol. i. p. 696., explain the origin of the word
  "Hurrah," respecting which one of your correspondents inquires:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It was a 'wise custom' in Normandy, established by Rollo's decree,
  that whoever sustained, or feared to sustain, any damage of goods or
  chattels, life or limb, was entitled to raise the country by the cry of
  <i>haro</i>, or <i>haron</i>, upon which cry all the lieges were bound to
  join in pursuit of the offender,&mdash;<i>Haron! Ha Raoul!</i> justice
  invoked in Duke Rollo's name. Whoever failed to aid, made fine to the
  sovereign; whilst a heavier mulct was consistently inflicted upon the
  mocker who raised the <i>clameur de haro</i> without due and sufficient
  cause, a disturber of the commonwealth's tranquillity.</p>

  <p>"The <i>clameur de haro</i> is the English system of 'hue and cry.'
  The old English exclamation <i>Harrow!</i> our national vernacular
  <i>Hurrah!</i> being only a variation thereof, is identical with the
  supposed invocation of the Norman chieftain; and the usage, suggested by
  common sense, prevailed under various modifications throughout the
  greater part of the Pays Coutumier of France."</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>Among the books which we have for some time intended to bring under
  the notice of our readers is a new and cheaper edition of <i>The Coin
  Collector's Manual, or Guide to the Numismatic Student in the Formation
  of a Cabinet of Coins: comprising an Historical and Critical Account of
  the Origin and Progress of Coinage, from the Earliest Period to the Fall
  of the Roman Empire; with some Account of the Coinages of Modern Europe,
  more especially of Great Britain, by</i> H. Noel Humphreys: and we have
  been the more anxious to do this, because, except among professed
  collectors, greater ignorance probably exists on the subject of coins,
  their date, value, &amp;c., than upon any other subject with which
  educated people are supposed to possess some acquaintance. Yet there are
  few numismatic questions likely to occur which ordinary readers would not
  be enabled to solve by a reference to these two little volumes, enriched
  as it is with numerous illustrations; especially if they would place
  beside them Akerman's most useful <i>Numismatic Manual</i>.</p>

  <p>We are indebted to Mr. Murray for two volumes which will be among the
  pleasant additions to the cheap books of the month, namely, the new
  volume, being the fourth of the reprint, of Lord Mahon's <i>History of
  England to the Peace of Versailles</i>, which comprises the interval
  between the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle and that of Hubertsburg; and in the
  <i>Railway Reading</i>, for half-a-crown! the fourth edition of
  Lockhart's spirited translations of <i>Ancient Spanish Ballads,
  Historical and Romantic</i>. Thanks, Mr. Murray, thanks!</p>

  <p>That Mr. De la Motte, who is so well known as an accomplished
  draughtsman, should turn his attention to photography, is no slight
  testimony to the value of the art. That he has become a master in it, may
  be seen by one glance at his own works on the walls of his Photographic
  Gallery. The beginner may therefore receive with confidence the results
  of that gentleman's experience; and <i>The Practice of Photography, a
  Manual for Students and Amateurs</i>, just published by him, will <!--
  Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"></a>{21}</span>be found
  a most useful and instructive companion to every one who is now
  contemplating an excursion, armed with a camera, for the purpose of
  securing for the gratification of his friends truthful records of his
  wanderings. Mr. De la Motte wisely confines his instruction to the paper
  and glass processes; his details on these are clear and minute, and the
  book is well worth the money for those pages of it alone which are
  devoted to the "Chemicals used in Photography."</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received.</span>&mdash;<i>On the Archaic Mode
  of expressing Numbers in English, Saxon, Friesic, &amp;c.</i>, by E.
  Thomson, Esq.; a learned and ingenious tract, written originally for
  insertion in "N. &amp; Q.," but which fact ought not to prevent our
  speaking of it in the terms which it deserves.&mdash;<i>A Few Words in
  Reply to the Animadversions of the Rev. Mr. Dyce on Mr. Hunter's
  "Disquisition on the Tempest," 1839, and his "New Illustrations of the
  Life, Studies, and Writings of Shakspeare," 1845, &amp;c.</i> A short but
  interesting contribution to Shakspearian criticism, by one who has
  already done good service in the same cause. If we cannot agree with Mr.
  Hunter in all that he seeks to establish, we can admire his knowledge of
  Elizabethan literature, and appreciate the spirit in which he
  writes.&mdash;<i>The Antiquary.</i> This is the first number of a small
  work consisting of reprints of proclamations, curious advertisements from
  early newspapers, and such odd matters as paint more forcibly than the
  gravest historian, the colours of the times.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Our Eighth Volume.</span> <i>We avail ourselves of
  the opportunity afforded by the commencement of a new Volume, to state
  that our attention has been called to the sharp and somewhat personal
  tone of several of the recent contributions to "N. &amp; Q.," and which,
  we are reminded, is the more striking from the marked absence of anything
  of that character in our earlier Volumes. We are perhaps ourselves
  somewhat to blame for this, from our strong indisposition to exercise our
  editorial privilege of omission. Our notice of the subject will, we are
  sure, be sufficient to satisfy our contributors of the inconvenience
  which must result to themselves as well as to us from the indulgence in
  too great license of the pen. We know that when men write</i> currente
  calamo, <i>words and phrases are apt to escape, the full application of
  which is not observed, until, as Charles Lamb said, "print proves it;"
  but being conscious that, when treating on the subjects with which we
  deal, no one would willingly write anything with design to give offence,
  we shall in future "play the tyrant" on all such occasions with more
  vigilance than we have done.</i></p>

<h3>BURKE'S PEERAGE AND BARONETAGE FOR 1853</h3>

<p class="cenhead">IS NOW READY,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>In 1 vol. royal 8vo., comprising as much matter as twenty ordinary
  volumes, with 1,500 accurate Engravings of Arms. Price 38<i>s.</i>
  bound.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This new and thoroughly revised edition has engaged the author's
  closest attention for a considerable time. Every line of its voluminous
  contents has been tested by the most minute research, and every page has
  been submitted to the members of the various noble and eminent families
  themselves. Much additional information of the deepest interest has thus
  been obtained. The collateral branches, too, have been fully investigated
  and inserted. In addition, great improvements have been made in the
  Heraldic Illustrations, and arrangement of the printing, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="cenhead">Also just published,</p>

<h3>BURKE'S LANDED GENTRY, CORRECTED FOR 1853,</h3>

  (upwards of 100,000) mentioned in the Work.</p>

  <p>The great expense attending the production of this important and truly
  national Work will preclude its being again printed in so extended and

  the only one afforded for obtaining it.</p>

  6<i>d.</i> each.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>"This very excellent edition of Evelyn's famous 'Diary' furnishes us
  with much interesting correspondence never before published. These
  volumes will be treasures to those who delight in genuine curiosities of
  literature, while to the student of history they will be invaluable. The
  work is a necessary companion to the popular histories of our
  country&mdash;to Hume, Hallam, Macaulay, and
  Lingard."&mdash;<i>Sun.</i></p>

  <p>Edited by ELIOT WARBURTON. Cheaper Edition, 2 vols. 8vo. with
  Portraits, 16<i>s.</i></p>

  <p>"The Memoirs of Horace Walpole nearly complete the chain of personal,
  political, and literary history, commencing with Evelyn and Pepys, and
  ending almost in our own day with the histories of Mr. Macaulay and Lord
  Mahon. The work is a necessary addition to the library of every English
